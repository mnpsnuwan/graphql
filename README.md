# GraphQL
- The GraphQL is a Query Language.
- Alternative to using a REST API

### REST API vs GraphQL
#### REST API
- Over fetching > Getting back more data than we need
- Under fetching > Getting back less data than we need. Then we have to request additional data using another API call.

#### GraphQL
- Single Endpoint > Getting all the data using single call.
